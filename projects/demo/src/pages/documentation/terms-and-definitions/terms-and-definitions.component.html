    <p>
        In this part of the docs we are explaining some basic NgDrawFlow terms and definition. Three things youâ€™ll be
        using a lot in NgDrawFlow are nodes, connections, and connectors.
    </p>
    <section>
        <h2>Nodes</h2>

        <app-nodes-example />

        <p>
            Node in NgDrawFlow is an Angular component. This means it can display anything you desire. Each node has X
            and Y coordinates that refer to the point at the center of the node, relative to the workspace. To create a
            node, you need to extend from
            <code>DrawFlowBaseNode</code>
            .
        </p>

        <p>
            To delete a node, select it and press
            <code>Delete</code>
            or
            <code>Backspace</code>
        </p>

        <p>Some of the things you might do with a custom node are:</p>

        <ul class="tui-list tui-list_small">
            <li class="tui-list__item">Render form elements</li>
            <li class="tui-list__item">Visualize data</li>
            <li class="tui-list__item">Support multiple connectors</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Connectors</h2>

        <app-connectors-example />

        <p>
            A Connector is used to link nodes together. By default they are displayed as blue circles but the colour can
            be changed using css variables. When creating a custom node, you may use as many connector handles as you
            need. The main requirement is that each connector has a unique name starting with its nodeId (example:
            <code>node-1-input-1</code>
            ). More information can be found in
            <a
                routerLink="/documentation/connectors"
                tuiLink
            >
                the connector documentation
            </a>
            .
        </p>
        <p>Connectors are divided into two types: input connectors and output connectors.</p>
        <p>
            To connect two nodes, simply drag an output connector from one node to an input connector of another node.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Connections</h2>

        <app-connections-example />

        <p>
            A Connection links two nodes together. It is represented by a Bezier curve. An edge is an SVG path, allowing
            its line thickness and color to be adjusted through CSS variables.
        </p>
        <p>
            To delete a connection, select it and press the
            <code>Delete</code>
            or
            <code>Backspace key</code>
            .
        </p>
