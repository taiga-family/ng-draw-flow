        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>To get started locally you should have a few things:</p>
        <ul class="tui-list tui-list_small">
            <li class="tui-list__item">
                <a

                installed.
            </li>
            <li class="tui-list__item">
                A working knowledge of
                <a

                    Angular
                </a>
                . You don't need to be an expert, but you should be comfortable with the basics.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>First, spin up a new Angular project</p>
        <code>ng new my-app</code>
        <p>NgDrawFlow is published on npm as ng-draw-flow, so go ahead and add it next.</p>
        <code>npm i &commat;ng-draw-flow/core --save</code>
        <p>Lastly, spin up the dev server and we're good to go!</p>
        <code>ng serve</code>

        <h2>Import Dependencies and Register Node Components</h2>

        <p>
            To get started with the ng-draw-flow library, begin by setting up your module with the necessary imports and
            component registrations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Add the
            <code>NgDrawFlowComponent</code>
            and
            <code>ReactiveFormsModule</code>
            to your module's imports array:
        </p>

        <tui-doc-code
            filename="app.module.ts"
            [code]="gettingStarted.imports"
        />

        <p>
            Then, within the providers section, register the components that you want to be available for use as nodes
            within the graph editor:
        </p>

        <tui-doc-code
            filename="app.module.ts"
            [code]="gettingStarted.providing"
        />

        <p>
            Make sure to replace
            <code>yourNode</code>
            with your specific component identifier for the node within the editor, and
            <code>YourNodeComponent</code>
            with the actual component class you intend to use.
        </p>
    </section>

        <h2>Set Up Data Model and Control for Graph Structure</h2>

        <p>
            In the component where you intend to construct your graph, you need to create a data structure that defines
            the nodes and connections.
        </p>

        <tui-doc-code
            filename="app.connectors.component.ts"
            [code]="gettingStarted.data1"
        />

        <p>
            Next, link this data structure to your ng-draw-flow component using a
            <code>FormControl</code>
            . This will allow for reactive updates and interactions within your graph editor:
        </p>

        <tui-doc-code
            filename="app.component.html"
            [code]="gettingStarted.template"
        />

        <p>
            This setup ensures that your ng-draw-flow component is fully integrated with the Angular forms system,
            enabling seamless data flow and state management for your graph.

        <h2>Populate Example DfDataModel</h2>

        <p>
            To illustrate how to set up the
            <code>DfDataModel</code>
            with actual data, the following example lays out a scenario with a collection of nodes and their
            connections:
        </p>

        <tui-doc-code
            filename="app.connectors.component.ts"
            [code]="gettingStarted.data2"
        />

        <p>
            Each
            <code>node</code>
            mainly consists of an
            <code>id</code>
            , a
            <code>position</code>
            , and a
            <code>data</code>
            field. Inside the
            <code>data</code>
            field, you need to specify the node type that was previously registered and all the data you want to provide
            to the node.
        </p>
        <p>
            The
            <code>connections</code>
            array contains objects that describe the start and end points of each connection. The
            <code>source</code>
            and
            <code>target</code>
            holds information about which node and specific connector are used for each connection.

        <h2>Creating Custom Nodes</h2>
        <p>
            In ng-draw-flow, nodes can be customized to look and function just how you want them to. To create your own
            node, you should develop a component that extends from the
            <code>NgDrawFlowBaseNode</code>
            class. This component will incorporate directives such as
            <code>DrawFlowInputDirective</code>
            and
            <code>DrawFlowOutputDirective</code>
            .
        </p>
        <p>Here is a basic blueprint for a simple node component:</p>

        <tui-doc-example
            style="padding: 0"
            [content]="customNodeExample"
        >
            <div class="node-demo">
                <ng-draw-flow [formControl]="nodeForm" />
            </div>
        </tui-doc-example>
    </section>
