<tui-doc-page header="Editor">
    Our graph editor is built to serve as an API-first platform, enabling developers to design their own UI elements and
    interact with the graph through exposed methods. This approach allows for the addition of new nodes and control over
    the zoom level, complete with the ability to display the current zoom, all while providing a customizable experience
    tailored to your application's needs.
